- **collaborative sessions for olive!**

`OliveCollaborate` provides *multi-user RPC sessions* for `Olive` notebooks. This functionality gives users connected to the same server the ability to share their sessions actively -- as one user modifies the project, the project updates for everyone else viewing the project. This project is still in *relatively early* development, but is coming surprisingly soon!
